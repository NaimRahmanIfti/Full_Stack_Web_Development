<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Naim Rahman Ifti — a passionate and curious student with a strong interest in coding and business.
   I'm currently building my skills in Python, Java, and HTML, and I've already started exploring the backend world — including working with databases and APIs.</p>

<p>My dream is to become a software developer or an AI developer, and one day, a successful businessman.
   I’m constantly pushing myself to learn new technologies, solve real problems, and grow both technically and personally.</p>

<p>I believe in continuous growth and never stop asking,
   “What’s next?” Whether it’s a new programming language or a fresh business idea, I’m always eager to learn more and become better every day.</p>
